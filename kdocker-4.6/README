KDocker
-------
KDocker will help you dock any application in the system tray. This means you
can dock openoffice, xmms, firefox, thunderbolt, eclipse, anything! Just point
and click. Works for both KDE and GNOME (In fact it should work for most modern
window managers that support NET WM Specification. I believe it works for XFCE,
for instance)

All you need to do is start KDocker and select an application using the mouse
and lo! the application gets docked into the system tray. The application can 
also be made to dissappear from the task bar.

System Tray Support
-------------------
KDocker supports the System Tray Protocol from freedesktop.org

Tips to use KDocker
-------------------
1. On KDE, right click on K menu and use the menu editor to create a link of
KDocker and create a shortcut (Windows key + Z). You could use the kdocker.xpm
in the src folder as the icon (its an anchor).
Rationale: ^Z on the shell puts processes in the background. On the same lines,
Windows+Z will help you put windows app to the background ;) (thanks to Thomas
McGuire for this suggestion)
2. With KDocker 0.9, there is an option to dock the current active window (-f).
As soon as you press WinKey+Z, the window which has the focus will be
automatically docked. Thanks to Daniel for this neat feature request.
